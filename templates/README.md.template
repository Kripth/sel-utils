The provided data can be used with the language's package manager (see the badges) or as git submodule.

You can choose a specific protocol using the combination `software` + `protocol` or the latest release of the protocol using just `software`.

```
git init .
git submodule add -b java316 git://github.com/sel-utils/java java316/sul
```
And add `java316` to your source paths

```
git init .
git submodule add -b pocket git://github.com/sel-utils/d pocket/sul
```
And compile using -Ipocket

Utils must always be added to submodules
```
